        <h3>Genetic Algorithm</h3>
        <img src="images/Project1Pic.png" alt="A genetic algorithm simulator that I made for a CSSE 220 project."/>
        <p>This was my final project for CSSE 220.  It is a genetic algorithm that 
          simulated evolution, while being able to change certain paramters, such as
        the type of selection, time period, and mutation rate. It was a fun project 
      that taught me a lot abut how to structure a larger program.</p>

        <h3>Archery Game Project</h3>
        <img src="images/Project2Pic.png" alt="A game I did in CSSE 120."/>
        <p>I coded this Apple-Shooter video game as a final project for CSSE 120.  It was a lot of fun to 
          make, and features variable angles, wind, and power. A lot of work went into making the arrow
          fly in a realistic fashion, while also allowing the wind, angle and power to have an effect on it.

        <h3>Personal Portfolio</h3>
        <img src="images/Project3Pic.png" alt="The portfolio project you are currently looking at."/>
        <p>You are currently looking at this project. This is the first course that I am taking in 
          HTML, CSS, and JS, so it has been challening to learn these new languages. This is one of the 
          projects that I will actually keep up-to-date and use in the future. I have definitely enjoyed 
          doing this project, as web design is a new and interesting subject that I am currently learning.
