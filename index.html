    <p> Hi! My name is Grant Ripperda, and I am a CS major from Sherman, IL. 
      It's a small town in the middle of the cornfields of Central Illinois,
    so you probably have never heard of it.  I am also on the football team 
  here at Rose-Hulman, which takes up most of my free time. When I am home/ 
  not in school, I enjoy riding fourwheelers and working on my cars.  I also 
run a woodworking business (@g.r.woodworking on Instagram), which I learned 
how to do through my dad. In high school most of my time was spent playing 
sports (football, wrestling, track), lifting, and working for my business. </p>
