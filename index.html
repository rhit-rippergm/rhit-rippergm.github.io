    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <img src="images/picOfMe.jpg" alt="Picture of Grant" class="center"/>
    <p id="bio"> Hi! My name is Grant Ripperda, and I am a CS major from Sherman, IL. 
      It's a small town in the middle of the cornfields of Central Illinois,
    so you probably have never heard of it.  I am also on the football team 
  here at Rose-Hulman, which takes up most of my free time. When I am home/ 
  not in school, I enjoy riding fourwheelers and working on my cars.  I also 
run a woodworking business (@g.r.woodworking on Instagram), which I learned 
how to do through my dad. In high school most of my time was spent playing 
sports (football, wrestling, track), lifting, and working for my business. </p>

  <h3>Genetic Algorithm</h3>

    <!-- <img src="images/Project1Pic.png" alt="A genetic algorithm simulator that I made for a CSSE 220 project."/> -->
    <p>This was my final project for CSSE 220.  It is a genetic algorithm that 
      simulated evolution, while being able to change certain paramters, such as
    the type of selection, time period, and mutation rate. It was a fun project 
  that taught me a lot abut how to structure a larger program.</p>

  <h3>Archery Game Project</h3>

  <ul>

  
  <li>
    
    <p>I coded this Apple-Shooter video game as a final project for CSSE 120.  It was a lot of fun to 
      make, and features variable angles, wind, and power. A lot of work went into making the arrow
      fly in a realistic fashion, while also allowing the wind, angle and power to have an effect on it.

  <h3>Personal Portfolio</h3>

  <ul>

 
  <li>
    
    <p>You are currently looking at this project. This is the first course that I am taking in 
      HTML, CSS, and JS, so it has been challening to learn these new languages. This is one of the 
      projects that I will actually keep up-to-date and use in the future. I have definitely enjoyed 
      doing this project, as web design is a new and interesting subject that I am currently learning. 
    </p>
